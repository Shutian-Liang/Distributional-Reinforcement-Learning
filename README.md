## Distributional Reinforcement Learning
by *shutian @CDLab*

This simulation is just for the journal club of CDLab and I do this just for presentation. I just change the learning rate to align with the paper:[Distributional Reinforcement Learning in the Brain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223620301983) and 
[A Neural Substrate of Prediction and Reward](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.275.5306.1593)

>[!Note]
> There is no Neural Network here and more mathematical principles about distributional reinforcemene learning, please refer to https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.275.5306.1593
